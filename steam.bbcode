[b]3.8.2✔️[/b]

[h2]Description:[/h2]
Before patch 3.8, in the vanilla game you could hire a lot of scientists with different [URL=https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Leader&oldid=66895#Expertise%3A_Computing]traits of Expertise[/URL] and swap them out as top researchers to affect the chance of getting the right technology.
It was an interesting and balanced system. There was moderate randomness that didn't turn the game into a Sid Meier's Civilization analogy, where the same branches with meta technologies were always explored, but at the same time, there was plenty of control over randomness.

After the patch, there's more randomness in the early and mid-game technology research, which is harder to control (except when you take the civilian model - Technocracy). 

[h2]Features:[/h2]
The mod adds a menu in which you can select the modifier of specialization of scientific research regardless of the leader. Selected modifiers give +25% chance to appear technologies of a certain category.

[URL=https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Scientist_traits#Researcher_Expertise_traits]Traits of Expertise[/URL] in scientists can stack with modifiers of this mod (it's a small buff for Technocracy).
